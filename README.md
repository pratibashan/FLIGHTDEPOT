# FLIGHTDEPOT


First Front-end Project at DigitalCrafts


### Overview:

A web application to search  and book flights. We used Fareportal api for flight details and availability.We used google api, for cities weather on the travel date. User can search flight with the search option of starting date, from and to city. When the destination city selected on a journey date, we use google api to retrieve weather data, which includes Temperature , climate conditions and image for an appropriate weather. Once they select the city and the date, we use Fareportal api to get the list of flight available with details which includes Flight name, Flight name and the seat availability. Users can checkout by selecting the desired flight.
